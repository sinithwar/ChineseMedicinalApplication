    <string name="herb_description">Underneath each section, you will find a Suggest Herbs for that section but you will
        find out what they do here. These herbs can go into any recipe that we provide you and these are Chinese Herbs
        that are in current use today. These are the most popular of all the Chinese Herbs and are a footstep into
        Chinese Herbology. Chinese Herbology is not strictly plants, albeit the name suggests otherwise, but rather a
        mixture of plants and herbs along with other common food ingredients. The idea is to mix these foods into your
        diet so that you can improve via your food, which we therefore will go over the 5 Element Diet, which is a
        Chinese Diet that is specifically intended to help your specific area of issue improve over time.

    <!--木元素饮食 (Mù yuánsù yǐnshí)-->
    <!--Spring Time, Green Foods, Rooted Thin Individuals-->
    <!--Suggested Foods: Sour Foods-->
    <!--Suggested Herbs: Shiitake Mushrooms, Cinnamon, Ginger, Peony, Ephedra-->
    <!--Environment Time: Spring-->
    <!--The Diet is designed for those who have Digestive Issues-->
    <!--Physical Exercise, Probiotics and Reading-->
    <!--Physical Exercise does quite a few things for you beyond getting you into shape. When you go for long periods without exercise, the digestive system tends to backtrack and you get a lot of issues due to a lack of burning calories and nutrients. Your body is a need only system in that it only uses what it needs. Therefore, if you tend to not burn a lot of calories then it will stop digesting large parts of the food in order to cope with this. This causes the intestinal lining to have food lodged within areas of itself and issues like GERD begin to develop as bacteria are allowed to feed on the food that's there for a prolonged period of time. When you exercise, the food is immediately burned in an attempt to balance out the fat that you have burned and the nutrients you have used.-->
    <!--There are bad bacteria and good bacteria, and what we want are the good bacteria. This type of bacteria tends to clean the intestine walls, break down food faster, and come in the form of Probiotics. Probiotics come in cultures of bacteria and this is important because these cultures are different types of bacteria. This increase in variety makes the intestines stronger and able to handle large quantities of food. Without a healthy amount of good bacteria, the bad bacteria begins to poison the remainder of the body.-->
    <!--Reading stimulates the mind and provides an individual with a goal. Humans are naturally tied to goals and when we experience continuous issues with achieving goals, this can begin to affect our health and our attitude. When our attitude goes down, so does our health due to the fact that our brain sends out a chemical, Cortisol, which has several damaging effects throughout the body. By setting goals with easier tasks, such as reading, an individual begins to feel like they have achieved something and this leads to a decrease in Cortisol.-->

    <!--Environment Time: Later Summer through Early Fall-->
    <!--The Diet is designed for those who are a bit round in shape.-->
    <!--Physical Exercise, Probiotics. Warm Foods, and a Breathing Practice-->
    <!--Physical Exercise does quite a few things for you beyond getting you into shape. When you go for long periods without exercise, the digestive system tends to backtrack and you get a lot of issues due to a lack of burning calories and nutrients. Your body is a need only system in that it only uses what it needs.

This increase in variety makes the intestines stronger and able to handle large quantities of food. Without a healthy amount of good bacteria, the bad bacteria begins to poison the remainder of the body.-->
    <!--When your body digests something, it first has to heat it up to your body's temperature. Temporarily, your body increases the acid in your stomach so that it can turn the temperature up in the food while also breaking it down. As the temperature gets to your own body's temperature, it also begins to dissolve at the same rate. This excess in acid can be a root cause in Acid Reflux and diseases caused by Acid Reflux. At the same time, the body loses heat in this process much like water first drops in temperature when ice is introduced into it but will eventually climb back up. This causes the body to tense up, which results in more Cortisol being dumped into your body. By introducing warm foods into your diet, you speed up digestion so that it doesn't take as much acid to dissolve it and you also warm your body to an increase temperature, which relaxes your muscles instead.-->
    <!--The last problem is anxiety or worrying all the time and this can be managed with breathing activities for a good portion. This is normally caused by an imbalance of cortisol and an easy way to deplete that hormone is to perform a simple breathing exercise.-->
    <!--Pinch the bridge of your nose.-->
    <!--Open your mouth wide and breath in deeply.-->
    <!--Hold this breath for 10 seconds.-->
    <!--Form your mouth as if you are about to suck out of a straw.-->
    <!--Breath out as slowly as you can.-->
    <!--Repeat this a couple times.-->
    <!--This should help you to immediately relax when you feel that you are worrying about something or feel anxiety.-->

    <!--Environment Time: Autumn-->
    <!--The Diet is designed for those who are muscularly built.-->
    <!--Physical Exercise, Peppermint Tea, and Warm Baths-->
    <!--Physical Exercise does quite a few things for you beyond getting you into shape. When you go for long periods without exercise, the digestive system tends to backtrack and you get a lot of issues due to a lack of burning calories and nutrients. Your body is a need only system in that it only uses what it needs. Therefore, if you tend to not burn a lot of calories then it will stop digesting large parts of the food in order to cope with this. This causes the intestinal lining to have food lodged within areas of itself and issues like GERD begin to develop as bacteria are allowed to feed on the food that's there for a prolonged period of time. A mostly unknown aspect about this is that these bacteria send toxins into the body, which then raises the immune response for the bacteria but, much like an army, when you allocate too many soldiers the immune system only has so many white blood cells. Therefore, you run into colds more and get infected more easily than your other counterparts. When you exercise, the food is immediately burned in an attempt to balance out the fat that you have burned and the nutrients you have used. Not only this, but exercise promotes your bone structure and considering that white blood cells come from bone marrow, this means you immune system will increase in its efficiency.-->
    <!--Tea is an excellent way to compliment meals and different teas have different effects. Peppermint Tea is especially good for those who get sick a lot as the peppermint acts as a airborne menthol, which means that it will help break up the mucus so that your body can handle it. It also helps relieve mental stress, excess gas, bloating, cramping, motion sickness, and can even reduce fevers.-->
    <!--Oddly enough, a nice warm bath would be good for a person who needs to follow the Metal Element Diet. Their muscular build has a tendency to work against itself, causing the consistent muscle cramps and overall sickness. Pain is caused by the brain and if we didn't have the brain to tell us we were in pain, we'd be in a lot of trouble. When you apply heat to an area that is under pain, it deactivates the pain receptors and shuts off the signals to the brain. This results in a loss of pain and a release of endorphins, your natural happy-go-lucky hormone.-->

    <!--Physical exercise does quite a few things for you beyond getting you into shape. For a water person, this tends to be related towards issues with the fluids in your body. This means that there is an off balance of the fluids and only with persistence can you correct the imbalances. When you exercise, the nutrients in your body begin to move around a lot more and this includes the fluids you will need to keep your health up.-->
    <!--There are a few liquids that can help clean up infections that are common ingredients in most drinks. Of course, water is very important for keeping the body clean but make sure the PH level is balanced at around 7-8. I am well aware that many are claiming that a high PH level is very good for you, but the PH level is only important if your body is already acidic. Otherwise, you need to look for products that provide you with naturally refined minerals that will build on what's already there for your body.-->
    <!--This brings us to Tea, which is going to be very good for you because it solely deals in liquids. On a regular basis I consume Lily, Earl Grey, Chai, Vanilla, White, and Green tea at varying amounts.  Lily, Earl, White, and Green Tea are all very good at detoxification. White is good for weight loss, Lily is great for stomach issues, Chai is good for the heart, and Green is good for overall health.

    <string name="fire_element_diet_description">Passionate Individuals, Acid Reflux Issues, High Blood Pressure,
        Circulatory Issues
        \nSuggested Foods: Warm Spicy Foods
        \nSuggested Herbs: Ginger, Salvia, Peony, Cinnamon, Dang Gui
        \nEnvironment Time: Summer
        \nThis Diet is designed for those who tend to be really focused and passionate.
        \n\nPhysical Exercise, Chai Tea, and Lavender Tea
        \nPhysical Exercise does quite a few things for you beyond getting you into shape. For a fire person, this tends
        to relate towards having issues with the heart. When you stand or sit for long periods of time, the veins in
        your legs begin to grow smaller as the muscles that pump the blood through grow weaker. This lack of blood flow
        not only risks a blood clot, but also causes a litany of other heart issues. By simply walking outside for a
        couple of hours, one can see that they have less and less of these issues.
        \n\nTea is an excellent way to compliment meals and different teas have different effects. Chai tea usually has
        a compound of Black Pepper or Cinnamon while Lavender Tea provides a calming effect and helps to relax the
        muscles. Black Pepper and Cinnamon are both good for your heart as they fight off the intake of fats entering
        your bloodstream. They also help to lower overall blood pressure given enough time. However, an unspoken aspect
        about heart related problems are the muscles around the veins. If you are in the cold a lot, stay in position
        for long periods of time, or lift heavy objects then you have likely felt the cramps in your body. We have
        small, medium, and large cramps throughout our body. What we are talking about here are the small and medium
        cramps, the ones we know as a twitch in a certain area. These twitches represent the fact that the muscles are
        pushing in on the veins. Lavender Tea helps relieve the twitching and relax the muscles so that this doesn't
        happen as often or at all.
